Three strengths I am currently developing are:
1. Acute attention to detail and uncompromising standards
2. Advanced understanding in the following technologies:
    + Python, Javascript/Typescript and related libraries (React.js, express.js, axios and more).
    + Web Development tools such as HTML/CSS (in addition to CSS frrameworks like styled-components, SCSS, LASS and Tailwind), React as previously mentioned and templating languages handlebars and pug.
    + Databases both relational and non-relational including MySQL, MongoDB, SQlite, PosgreSQL and ORMs such as Prisma, TypeORM and others. 
3. Finally, continued teachability in both new and evolving technologies and methodologies of working and completeing tasks assigned to me.

Values important to me include:
1. Honesty. I feel that being honest accelerates progress by minimizing time wasted on deceit or hidden agendas. The truth's inevitable revelation ensures a straightforward and efficient path toward goals, eliminating unnecessary detours and fostering a more direct and transparent approach.
2. Work Ethic. A strong work ethic is the cornerstone of professional success, signifying dedication, reliability, and a commitment to delivering results. It not only ensures consistent productivity but also cultivates a positive reputation, fostering trust among colleagues and employers. A robust work ethic is a key driver for personal and organizational growth, creating a solid foundation for achieving long-term success in any professional setting.
